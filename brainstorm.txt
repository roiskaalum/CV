TODO:
  - Playground site with a link to it, where I can show off webgl, and other cool effects I figure out how to do.
    This can include the webgl project we've already done.

  - Index page should have the introduction, and link to projects, and playground,
    and maybe even link to a contact page with
    detailed descriptions of how to get in touch with me,
    whereas the index page only has something like a mail etc.

  - Contact page can contain a contact formula.

  - We should do a mobile and pc design and make considerations for both.

Current TODO:

  - Make index first:
      - Figure out the content the index should contain.
      - This means the calls to action, introductions, list of capabilities etc.
      - Cool transitions between each of these, and for every capability, link to one project that demonstrates it.
      - Footer and Header, anchor tag, content list with anchor tags.
      - Detailed list:
          - Top anchor tag ID.
          - Header
          - Brief description.
          - 3 sections of paragraphs with info with some transition into it
          - Section of showing off with css or js techniques with scrolling
          - Section that introduces playground html page function.
          - If I have some flatrate to do work on free lance basis, introduce that here.
          - Scroll to the footer that is collapseable, and when we first load in the page, have an animation that closes footer as well.
          - on the footer, we should have some basic email info, copyright, and then some social links etc.
      - I also need an avatar, logo and basic theme throughout.
      - Need to design with dark and light mode in mind from the start, so use colors with a design in mind to begin with.
      - RGB randomising looks kinda good.
      - 3D model of myself even, display blender skills, and using Unity publishing to webgl,
        I can make that model interactable, and have animations etc.
      - Brainstorming for colors:
          - RGB PC Building, going into a section of deepspace, into maybe something retro?
          - RGB Pc Buiilding because those parts generally have RGB, so using those as inspo for theme seems cool.
          - Typing animations.
